How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It helps to bug my code and make a fast comparison between them that 
allows me to find out where the error or typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
 it allows us to have more experience and be aware more about mistakes
it is good to to look throught history as fragments and seal with each fragment separatly
get everything together in the right way

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
well getting it manually is good if i did the commits right in each logical change but what if i forget to commit or did it wrong way so it will be too big or too small so the best thing is getting more familiar with GIT and commiting right 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-in order to track the whole system together effciently we need multiple saving 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log let me see the whole commits done and so i can see every step done ,while git diff let me see what diffrent has been done from a step to another by details

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    using git checkout i can run my program at any time of my commits that i recorded so now i can do whatever i want knowing thqt i can go back in time to the right point 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
saving old version of  my files 
comparing them
